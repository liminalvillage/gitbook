# Internal Family Systems

Internal Family Systems (IFS) is a therapeutic model developed by Dr. Richard Schwartz in the 1980s. It is based on the premise that the human psyche is made up of multiple parts or subpersonalities, each with its own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.

According to IFS, some of these parts are in a healthy state and are able to function well, while others are stuck in negative patterns and are causing distress or dysfunction.&#x20;

The goal of IFS is to help individuals develop a better relationship with these different parts of themselves, and to learn to work with them in a more integrated and compassionate way. This can involve identifying and acknowledging different parts of oneself, understanding their roles and motivations, and learning to communicate with them in a way that fosters self-awareness and self-compassion.

In a group setting, IFS can be practiced in a number of ways. One approach is to use guided meditations or visualizations to help group members connect with different parts of themselves and explore their roles and motivations. Another approach is to use group discussions or exercises to help individuals share their experiences and insights, and to provide support and feedback to one another.

Group  sessions can also provide a safe and supportive environment for individuals to explore and work through difficult emotions and experiences, and to develop greater self-awareness and self-compassion.

The first step in IFS is often to identify the different parts of yourself and give them names or labels. For example, you may have a "protective" part that tries to keep you safe from harm, a "critical" part that judges and criticizes you, or a "pleaser" part that seeks approval from others.

Once you have identified your parts, the next step is to begin working with them. This may involve visualizing and interacting with them in a safe and supportive environment, learning to understand their motivations and needs, and developing strategies for integrating them into your overall sense of self.

Ultimately, the goal of IFS is to help you develop greater self-awareness and self-compassion, while also learning to work with your parts in a way that promotes healing, growth, and overall well-being.
