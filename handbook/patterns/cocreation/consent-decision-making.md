# Consent Decision Making

Proposals become agreements when they are considered _good enough for now and safe enough to try_ until the next review.

Unresolved objections prevent proposals from becoming agreements.

Withholding objections can harm the objectives of a team or organization.

#### Implicit Contract of Consent <a href="#implicit-contract-of-consent" id="implicit-contract-of-consent"></a>

1. In the absence of objections to an agreement, I intend to follow through on the agreement to the best of my ability.
2. I agree to share objections as I become aware of them.
