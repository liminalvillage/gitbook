# Task and Role-Based Operating System

At Liminal Village, being part of the community means collaborating, aligning, and operating through a decentralized system organized around **roles** (ongoing accountabilities) and **tasks** (specific actions). This replaces traditional hierarchies with consent-based, self-organizing coordination.

## Overview

Traditional organizations operate through **positional authority** - managers tell subordinates what to do, decisions flow top-down, and people are defined by their job titles.

Liminal Village operates through **distributed authority** - roles carry specific accountabilities consented to by the community, tasks emerge from real needs and are self-assigned, and people fluidly move between multiple roles based on capacity and interest.

This task and role-based operating system enables:
- **Clarity** - Everyone knows who's accountable for what
- **Autonomy** - People have authority to act within their roles
- **Adaptability** - Roles and tasks evolve as needs change
- **Consent** - No one is coerced into roles or tasks they object to
- **Transparency** - All roles and tasks are visible to the community

## Core Concepts

### Roles vs. Tasks

**Roles** are ongoing accountabilities that persist over time:
- A role has a clear **purpose** (why it exists)
- Defined **accountabilities** (what it's responsible for)
- Specific **domain** (what it has authority over)
- **Filled by consent** through the Role Selection process
- Can be held by one or multiple people
- Evolve through governance meetings

**Tasks** are specific, time-bound actions:
- Emerge from roles, tensions, or community needs
- Self-assigned based on capacity and interest
- Completed and checked off
- Don't require formal consent (unless significant)
- Can be done solo or with Task Buddies
- Tracked on "Did this" boards

**Example:**
- **Role:** "Kitchen Coordinator" - Purpose: "Ensure community has access to nourishing meals." Accountabilities: "Organize meal planning, maintain kitchen supplies, coordinate cooking schedules."
- **Tasks:** "Order 50 lbs of rice," "Clean fridge," "Organize Saturday meal prep with volunteers," "Update kitchen inventory spreadsheet"

```

## How Roles Work

### Creating Roles

**Roles are created when a recurring need or accountability emerges:**

**Step 1: Navigate via Tension**
- Someone senses something isn't working or is needed
- "I notice our kitchen is often chaotic and we run out of supplies unexpectedly"
- This tension signals a need for a role

**Step 2: Propose Role in Governance Meeting**
- Use **Co-Create Proposals** pattern
- Draft role with: Name, Purpose, Accountabilities, Domain
- Example:

```
Role: Kitchen Coordinator
Purpose: Ensure community has reliable access to nourishing meals
Accountabilities:
  - Maintain kitchen supply inventory
  - Coordinate weekly meal planning
  - Organize cooking schedules
  - Keep kitchen clean and functional
Domain:
  - Kitchen budget allocation
  - Kitchen supply ordering
  - Kitchen scheduling
```

**Step 3: Consent Decision Making**
- Community reviews proposal
- Raise objections if the role would cause harm
- Integrate objections to improve the role
- Adopt through consent (no remaining objections)

### Filling Roles

**Use the Role Selection pattern (see handbook/patterns/cocreation/role-selection.md)**

**9-Step Consent-Based Process:**
1. Present the role
2. Clarifying questions
3. Nominations (anyone can nominate anyone, including themselves)
4. Nomination round (why you nominated that person)
5. Change nominations (optional)
6. Proposal (facilitator proposes based on nominations)
7. Objection round
8. Integration (resolve objections)
9. Celebration

**Key Principles:**
- You can nominate yourself (self-selection is valid!)
- You can decline a nomination
- Multiple people can share a role
- Roles can rotate (e.g., monthly Kitchen Coordinator)
- Role holders have authority within their domain
- Community can recall/revise roles through governance

### Role Authority

**Within their domain, role holders have authority to:**
- Make decisions without asking permission
- Take actions aligned with their accountabilities
- Spend allocated budget
- Organize people and resources
- Create tasks and request help

**Example:**
- Kitchen Coordinator doesn't need to ask permission to order rice (within domain)
- Kitchen Coordinator CAN'T decide to renovate the entire kitchen (outside domain)
- Kitchen Coordinator CAN'T force someone to cook (no coercion)
- Kitchen Coordinator CAN post requests for cooking help (offers and requests)

### Role Evolution

**Roles are updated regularly through governance:**

**When to Update:**
- Role accountabilities are unclear or overlapping
- Role is too large (split into multiple roles)
- Role is no longer needed (sunset it)
- New accountabilities need to be added
- Role holder requests changes

**Process:**
- Bring tension to governance meeting
- Propose role update using Co-Create Proposals
- Get consent from community
- Update role documentation

## How Tasks Work

### Task Emergence

**Tasks emerge from multiple sources:**

**From Roles:**
- Kitchen Coordinator role generates tasks: "Order supplies," "Clean fridge," "Plan Saturday meal"

**From Community Needs:**
- Posted on **Offers and Requests** board
- Surfaced in **Open Space** gatherings
- Identified through **Navigate via Tension**

**From Projects:**
- Building a root cellar generates: "Excavate hole," "Build walls," "Install shelving," "Waterproof interior"

**From Tensions:**
- "The solar panels need cleaning" → Task: "Clean solar panels"

### Task Assignment

**Tasks are self-assigned, not assigned by authority:**

**Self-Selection:**
- See task on board or hear need in meeting
- Assess: Do I have capacity? Skills? Interest?
- Claim task: "I'll do this"
- Optionally find Task Buddy

**Task Buddy System (recommended):**
- Partner with someone to work together
- Mutual validation and support
- Share flow tokens if applicable
- Learn from each other

**Posting Tasks:**
- Use **Offers and Requests** board
- "Request: Someone to help build raised garden beds this Saturday"
- Include: what needs doing, when, what skills/resources needed, contact info

**Example Flow:**
```
Kitchen Coordinator identifies need → Posts task: "Need help organizing
Saturday community meal - cooking, setup, cleanup" → Three people
self-select → They work as buddies → Meal happens → They attest on
"Did this" board → Receive recognition/flow tokens
```

### Task Completion

**When task is done:**

1. **Attest on "Did this" board**
   - "Cleaned kitchen, organized pantry, created inventory sheet - 3 hours - Alex & Jordan"

2. **Update any relevant tracking**
   - Mark task complete on project board
   - Update role documentation if needed
   - Remove from Offers and Requests

3. **Share outcomes**
   - Tell Kitchen Coordinator (if task was role-generated)
   - Share at full moon gathering if significant
   - Post in community forum/chat

4. **Receive recognition**
   - Community gratitude
   - Flow tokens if applicable
   - Appreciative Scoring from peers

- What tensions am I noticing?

**During Work:**
- Am I acting within my role authority?
- Do I need to post a request for help?
- Should I find a task buddy?
- Am I working on what truly matters?

**Evening/Weekly Reflection:**
- What did I complete? (Attest on "Did this")
- What tasks remain?
- What tensions emerged?
- What roles need updating?

**Monthly/Lunar Cycle:**
- New Moon: Governance meeting, role updates, set intentions
- Full Moon: Share completions, attest contributions, receive flow tokens
- Navigate tensions throughout the cycle

## Integration with Other Patterns

### Governance Patterns

**Open Space** - Surface needs that become roles or tasks
**Consent Decision Making** - Approve role creation/updates
**Navigate via Tension** - Identify when roles need evolution
**Co-Create Proposals** - Draft role descriptions collaboratively
**Resolve Objections** - Integrate concerns about roles
**Role Selection** - Fill roles through consent
**Driver Mapping** - Understand what drives need for roles

### Operational Patterns

**Task Buddy** - Partner for task completion
**Offers and Requests** - Surface tasks that need doing
**Did this** - Attest task completion and role fulfillment
**Flow Tokens** - Recognize contributions from roles and tasks
**Appreciative Scoring** - Peer feedback on role performance
**Lunar Rhythms** - Time governance and operations with natural cycles

### Communication Patterns

**Psychological Safety** - Required for honest tension surfacing
**Imago Dialogue** - Resolve role conflicts
**Sharing Circle** - Process experiences in roles
**MonoLogs/DiaLogs/TriaLogs** - Structure role-related conversations

## Common Questions

### "Who's in charge?"

No one is "in charge" hierarchically. Authority is distributed through roles. If you want to know who's responsible for something, look at role accountabilities. The Kitchen Coordinator has authority over kitchen matters. The Garden Coordinator has authority over garden matters. Each domain has clear accountability.

### "What if no one wants to do a task?"

**Option 1:** The task might not be important. If it's truly urgent, someone will feel the tension and respond.

**Option 2:** Make the request more appealing - offer to teach the skill, provide resources, work as buddies, or offer flow tokens.

**Option 3:** Three Pathways - Purchase it (pay someone), Produce it (learn to do it), or Attract it (collective effort with pooled resources).

### "What if someone isn't fulfilling their role?"

**Step 1:** Direct feedback - use Imago Dialogue or direct conversation. "I'm noticing kitchen supplies haven't been ordered - what's happening?"

**Step 2:** Governance conversation - bring tension to meeting. "I'm sensing Kitchen Coordinator role needs support or restructuring."

**Step 3:** Role update or re-selection - either add support, reduce accountabilities, or select new role holder through consent process.

### "How do I know what to work on?"

**Listen to your energy and tensions:**
- What needs doing that aligns with my gifts?
- What posted requests call to me?
- What role accountabilities do I hold?
- What would I regret NOT doing?

**Check the boards:**
- Offers and Requests - what's needed?
- Project boards - what tasks are available?
- Role documentation - what are my accountabilities?

**Ask:**
- "What's needed right now?"
- "Who needs support?"
- "Where's the energy?"

### "Can I create a new role?"

Yes! If you notice a recurring need or accountability that no existing role covers:
1. Sense the tension
2. Draft a role proposal
3. Bring to governance meeting
4. Get consent from community
5. Run role selection process
6. Begin operating in the role

### "What if I want to leave a role?"

Roles are not forever. You can:
- Announce intention to step down (give notice for transition)
- Help find/train replacement
- Attend governance meeting where new selection happens
- Release the role with gratitude and grace

## Real-World Example: Building a Root Cellar

**Scenario:** Community needs food storage

**Tension Surfaced:**
"We're growing lots of food but have nowhere to store it long-term. Produce is spoiling."

**Governance Meeting:**
- Tension raised using Navigate via Tension
- Discussion: Is this big enough for a role or just a project?
- Decision: It's a project (time-bound), but might generate an ongoing "Food Storage Coordinator" role later

**Project Formation (Open Space):**
- Open Space session: "Who wants to work on root cellar project?"
- 8 people interested
- Self-organize into tasks:
  - Research designs (Alex)
  - Site selection (Jordan & Casey)
  - Excavation (Riley, Sam, Morgan)
  - Building walls (Alex, Jordan)
  - Installing shelves (Casey)
  - Waterproofing (Riley)

**Task Execution:**
- Each person/pair works on their tasks
- They use Task Buddy system
- Post requests on Offers and Requests: "Need someone with concrete experience"
- Someone external responds, teaches concrete skills
- Work happens over 3 lunar cycles

**Task Attestation:**
- Each completion goes on "Did this" board
- Full moon gatherings: share progress, celebrate milestones
- Photos and documentation shared

**Flow Token Distribution:**
- Hours contributed tracked
- Flow tokens distributed monthly to contributors
- External teacher receives payment + tokens

**Role Creation:**
- Root cellar complete, but needs ongoing maintenance
- New tension: "Someone should manage root cellar usage, temperature, rotation"
- New role created: "Root Cellar Coordinator"
- Role selected through consent
- Riley chooses to hold role
- Ongoing tasks emerge from role: "Monitor temperature," "Organize harvest storage," "Teach usage to new members"

## Transitioning to This System

**If you're new to Liminal Village:**

**Week 1-2: Observer**
- Attend governance meeting (observer role)
- Read role documentation
- Notice what tasks are posted
- Ask questions, don't commit yet

**Week 3-4: Small Tasks**
- Claim one small task
- Work with a Task Buddy
- Attest completion on "Did this"
- Experience the flow

**Month 2: More Engagement**
- Claim larger tasks aligned with your gifts
- Participate in governance (raise tensions, give consent)
- Consider which roles interest you

**Month 3+: Full Participation**
- Potentially hold one or more roles
- Regular task contribution
- Active governance participation
- Supporting others to integrate

## Why This Works

**Decentralized Authority:**
- No bottlenecks waiting for manager approval
- Fast response to emerging needs
- Authority distributed to those closest to the work

**Intrinsic Motivation:**
- Self-selection ensures people work on what energizes them
- Consent means no coercion
- Attestation provides recognition

**Clarity Without Control:**
- Roles make accountability clear
- No need for micromanagement
- Trust with verification

**Evolutionary:**
- Roles and tasks adapt as needs change
- System evolves through tension sensing
- No rigid structures that resist change

**Regenerative:**
- Values all forms of contribution (labor, care, wisdom, materials)
- Flow tokens recognize what conventional economy ignores
- Builds capacity while meeting needs

Being at Liminal Village means embracing this task and role-based operating system - not as rigid rules but as living patterns that enable collaborative, aligned, and effective action. It's a shift from "someone tell me what to do" to "I sense what's needed and respond," from "boss and subordinate" to "roles and accountabilities," from extraction to regeneration.

The system works because it honors human autonomy while creating clear structure, enables rapid adaptation while maintaining coherence, and recognizes all forms of contribution while maintaining focus on real needs. This is how regenerative communities coordinate at scale without coercion - through consent, transparency, and distributed authority flowing through roles and tasks.
