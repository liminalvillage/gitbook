# Resolve Objections

Choose an option for resolving an objection that looks most promising and, if that fails, simply pick another one. Each attempt will help you understand more of the information the objection contains, and bring the group closer to proposing an amendment that resolves the objection.

Often, asking the person who brings the objection to propose an amendment, is a productive place to start.

Typically itâ€™s most effective to **take one objection at a time**, resolve all objections to a proposed amendment, and then continue with the next main objection.
