# Rock, Paper, Scissors Proficiency

Participants can indicate their proficiency to other (eg: by wearing a sticker). This can also change in time.

**Rock:** coders, handy-man, everyone that would like to get their hands dirty and just build, with or without a plan.&#x20;

**Paper:**  architects, system thinkers, everyone that would like to draw, discuss and iterate on the plan of execution.

**Scissor:**  Decorators, UX designers, graphic designers, crafters, artisans, etc..  the touch that would bring what the rock and paper have created into a beautiful piece of art.&#x20;

Proficiencies can be used to form balanced and complete teams, or to organize  activities / workshops focused on a specific proficiency.
