# Three Pathways to Abundance

Every solution can be accessed through three pathways: Purchase it with money, Produce it locally using open-source plans, or Attract it collectively by pooling resources. This creates optionality, reduces dependence, and establishes local abundance before external trade.

## Overview

Rather than assuming the only way to meet needs is through purchasing (money flows out, dependence increases), regenerative communities recognize three distinct pathways for accessing any solution:

**1. Purchase** - Buy it from someone (money flows in, supports the network)
**2. Produce** - Get open-source plans, become a production center, serve nearest subscribers automatically
**3. Attract** - Pool local resources collectively to manifest it together (land, labor, materials, expertise)

This framework transforms communities from passive consumers to active creators, reduces extraction, builds capacity, and establishes abundance locally before seeking external trade.

## The Three Pathways Explained

### Pathway 1: Purchase

**"I'll buy it from someone who's already producing it."**

**How it works:**
- Someone in the network (or outside it) already provides this solution
- You pay money for it
- Money flows support the producer
- If purchased from within the network, money recirculates and becomes available for flow token distribution

**When to use:**
- You need it immediately and lack capacity to produce
- Someone nearby already produces it well
- Your time is better spent on other contributions
- Supporting another community member's livelihood aligns with values

**Example:**
- "Our community needs fresh bread. Jordan's bakery is 10 miles away and makes excellent bread. We'll subscribe to weekly delivery and pay for it."

**Regenerative aspect:**
- Money flows *into* the network when external communities purchase
- Money circulates *within* the network when internal communities purchase from each other
- Supports livelihoods aligned with regenerative practices

### Pathway 2: Produce

**"I'll make it myself using open-source plans and become a local production center."**

**How it works:**
- Access open-source designs, recipes, plans, or blueprints (licensed under regenerative terms)
- Develop capacity to produce locally
- Serve nearest subscribers automatically (local-first distribution)
- Become a node in the production network
- Can sell surplus externally (money flows in)

**When to use:**
- Multiple community members express the same need (demand signal)
- You have capacity, interest, or skills aligned with producing it
- Local production reduces transportation/dependence
- Solution requires customization for local context
- You want to build that skill or livelihood

**Example:**
- "Five households need fresh bread weekly. I love baking and have time. I'll access the open-source sourdough bread recipe and production process, set up a small bakery, and supply my neighbors. When I have surplus, I'll sell to external communities."

**Regenerative aspect:**
- Builds local capacity and resilience
- Reduces dependence on external supply chains
- Open-source plans spread innovations rapidly
- Creates livelihoods rooted in meeting real needs
- Regenerative license ensures (e.g., "50% of grain must come from regenerative farms")

### Pathway 3: Attract

**"We'll pool our resources collectively and manifest it together."**

**How it works:**
- Community members with different resources collaborate
- Some contribute land, others labor, others materials, others expertise, others money
- The resource manifests through collective effort
- Ownership and access are shared among contributors
- No single person had to purchase it alone

**When to use:**
- The need is too large or expensive for one person
- Multiple community members want access to the same resource
- Collective ownership makes more sense than individual (e.g., tools, land, infrastructure)
- Building it together builds relationships and skills

**Example:**
- "We need a root cellar for food storage. Casey has land, Alex has excavation skills, Jordan can provide materials, Riley knows traditional building techniques, and Sam can contribute money for what we can't source locally. Together we build a shared root cellar everyone can use."

**Regenerative aspect:**
- Creates commons rather than individual ownership
- Distributes cost across community
- Builds skills and relationships through co-creation
- Resources serve multiple people simultaneously
- Flow tokens can recognize each person's contribution

## How the Pathways Create Abundance

### Traditional Scarcity Model

**Need → Purchase Only → Money Leaves Community → Dependence Increases**

- Community identifies need
- Only option is to buy from external supplier
- Money flows out
- No local capacity developed
- If external supply disrupted, community is vulnerable
- Repeat with every need = extraction

### Regenerative Abundance Model

**Need → Assess Three Pathways → Choose Based on Context → Local Capacity Increases**

- Community identifies need
- Evaluate all three options
- Choose pathway that builds most capacity/resilience/connection
- Money either recirculates internally or stays in community
- Local production capacity increases over time
- External dependence decreases
- Abundance established locally before external trade

## Decision Framework: Which Pathway?

Ask these questions to choose the appropriate pathway:

### Question 1: Is someone locally already producing this well?

**Yes →** Consider **Purchase** from them (supports local livelihood, recirculates money)
**No →** Continue to Question 2

### Question 2: Is there demand from multiple people/households?

**Yes →** Strong signal for **Produce** pathway (demand justifies building local capacity)
**No →** Continue to Question 3

### Question 3: Is it too expensive/large for one person?

**Yes →** Consider **Attract** pathway (pool resources collectively)
**No →** Consider **Purchase** externally if no local option exists

### Question 4: Do we have time/skills/interest to produce locally?

**Yes →** **Produce** builds capacity, resilience, and potentially livelihood
**No →** **Purchase** or **Attract** depending on size/cost

### Question 5: What builds the most local resilience?

**Consider:**
- Which pathway reduces external dependence most?
- Which builds skills and relationships?
- Which creates commons vs. private ownership?
- Which aligns with regenerative values?

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Solar Power

**Need:** Community needs renewable energy for 20 households

**Purchase Pathway:**
- Buy solar installation from external company
- Cost: $200,000
- Money leaves community
- Maintenance depends on external expertise
- No local capacity built

**Produce Pathway:**
- Access open-source solar installation guides
- 3 community members take training
- They install systems for all 20 households
- Cost: $120,000 (materials only, labor is internal)
- Community now has solar expertise
- Can install for other communities (money flows in)
- Maintenance is local
- Flow tokens distributed to installers

**Attract Pathway:**
- Each household contributes what they can: land for panels, labor, materials, money, expertise
- Community builds shared solar array collectively
- Cost: $100,000 (distributed across all households)
- Owned collectively
- Everyone learns basics of solar maintenance
- Deep relationships built through collaboration
- Flow tokens recognize each contribution

**Result:** Community chooses **Attract** for first pilot (5 households), then **Produce** as skilled members emerge who can serve the other 15 households and external communities.

### Example 2: Fresh Bread

**Need:** 15 households want fresh bread weekly

**Purchase Pathway:**
- Buy from bakery 20 miles away
- Cost: $8/loaf × 15 loaves × 52 weeks = $6,240/year
- Money leaves community
- Dependent on external baker and transportation
- No local capacity built

**Produce Pathway:**
- Alex accesses open-source sourdough recipe and small bakery setup plans
- Starts weekly baking for 15 subscribers
- Cost to community: $5/loaf × 15 × 52 = $3,900/year
- Alex receives $3,900 + flow tokens for meeting community need
- Surplus sold externally brings money in
- Community has baker if Alex travels/sick, others can learn
- Resilience increases

**Attract Pathway:**
- Community builds shared wood-fired oven
- 5 people take turns baking weekly
- Each household contributes labor 3-4 times/year
- Ingredients sourced from community garden and local grain farmers
- Minimal money cost, mostly labor exchange
- Baking becomes social event
- Everyone learns the skill

**Result:** Community chooses **Produce** (Alex loves baking, wants that livelihood). If Alex ever needs to step back, they have option to shift to **Attract** model since plans are open-source.

### Example 3: Childcare

**Need:** 8 families need childcare 20 hours/week

**Purchase Pathway:**
- Hire external childcare provider
- Cost: $25/hour × 20 hours × 8 kids = $4,000/week = $208,000/year
- Money leaves community
- Children cared for by someone outside their community
- No relationships built

**Produce Pathway:**
- 2 community members become trained childcare providers
- Serve the 8 families
- Cost: $15/hour × 20 hours × 8 kids = $2,400/week = $124,800/year
- Money recirculates in community + flow tokens to providers
- Children build deep relationships with caregivers who are neighbors
- Providers have sustainable livelihood

**Attract Pathway:**
- 8 families create cooperative childcare
- Each family contributes 1 day/week
- Minimal money cost, mostly labor exchange
- Children grow up with "village" of caregivers
- All adults develop childcare skills
- Deep relationships among families

**Result:** Community chooses **Attract** model (cooperative) with option for families to "buy out" their shift if needed (hybrid approach), creating flexibility.

## Subscription Model Integration

**For recurring needs, subscriptions create stable demand signals:**

**Community posts subscription needs:**
- "15 households need 1 loaf of bread weekly"
- "20 households need 100 kWh electricity monthly"
- "8 families need childcare 20 hours/week"

**Creators respond through pathways:**
- **Purchase:** Existing producers see demand and offer to supply
- **Produce:** Someone sees demand signal and becomes local producer
- **Attract:** Community collectively organizes to meet the need

**Auto-matching:**
- Nearest producer automatically serves nearest subscribers (reduces transportation)
- If no local producer exists, demand signal persists until someone steps into **Produce** pathway

## Open-Source + Regenerative Licensing

**Key to Produce pathway working at scale:**

**Open-Source Plans:** All solutions are open-sourced (recipes, designs, blueprints, processes)

**Regenerative License:** Plans carry requirements:
- "50% of farmland must restore nature"
- "Materials must be locally sourced where possible"
- "Labor must receive living wage or flow tokens"
- "Derivative works carry same license"

**Benefits:**
- Innovations spread rapidly across network
- Anyone can become producer
- Regenerative practices embedded in all production
- Commons grows while innovation accelerates
- Success spreads naturally

## Transitioning Between Pathways

**Communities can shift pathways as capacity evolves:**

**Year 1:** **Purchase** externally (no local capacity yet)
**Year 2:** Someone learns the skill → **Produce** locally
**Year 3:** More demand emerges → **Attract** model for shared infrastructure
**Year 4:** Local capacity surplus → **Produce** for external communities (money flows in)

**The progression builds resilience:**
- Immediate needs met through **Purchase**
- Capacity built through **Produce**
- Commons created through **Attract**
- Abundance shared externally through regenerative trade

## Related Patterns

- **Offers and Requests:** Surface needs that reveal which pathway is appropriate
- **Did this:** Track contributions regardless of pathway chosen
- **Flow Tokens:** Recognize contributions from **Produce** and **Attract** pathways
- **Task Buddy:** Partner up to **Produce** or **Attract** together
- **Open Space:** Use to decide collectively which pathway to choose
- **Consent Decision Making:** Get consent on significant **Attract** investments

The Three Pathways transform every purchase decision into an opportunity for capacity building, relationship deepening, and local abundance creation. Instead of defaulting to extraction, communities ask: "How might we meet this need in a way that increases our collective resilience, skills, and interdependence?" This is the foundation of regenerative economics.
