# Flow Tokens & Resource Distribution

A decentralized resource distribution system where tokens flow to those contributing toward collective needs, creating optionality, abundance, and multi-resource accounting beyond money.

## Overview

Flow tokens are a mechanism for distributing collective resources based on contributions that serve community needs. Unlike traditional payment for discrete tasks, flow tokens recognize the full spectrum of value creation - labor, materials, expertise, land access, emotional support, ecological restoration, and more.

Monthly or cyclical distributions create a predictable flow of resources to contributors, establishing universal optionality across the network: everyone has options because everyone's contributions are recognized and valued.

## Why Use Flow Tokens

**Multi-Resource Accounting:** Tracks value beyond money - labor, materials, land, knowledge, care work, and regenerative impacts all become visible and recognized.

**Aligns Incentives with Needs:** Resources flow to those addressing real community needs rather than those best at extracting profit or capturing attention.

**Creates Optionality:** Regular token distribution means contributors have options - they're not locked into survival transactions but can make choices aligned with their values and the community's evolution.

**Enables Transition:** For those moving from conventional economy to regenerative systems, flow tokens provide bridge income while building new capacities.

**Recognizes Invisible Labor:** Care work, facilitation, emotional labor, and maintenance activities that often go uncompensated become visible and valued.

**Drives Toward Circularity:** When negative externalities (waste, pollution, conflict) become tracked needs that generate flow tokens when solved, systems naturally move toward circularity.

## How It Works

### 1. Community Needs Expression

**Holons (community units) express needs as inputs:**
- "We need 100 lbs of organic flour monthly"
- "We need childcare coverage 20 hours per week"
- "We need our greywater system repaired"
- "We need conflict mediation training"

These needs can be posted on **Offers and Requests** boards, in community forums, or tracked digitally through platforms.

### 2. Contribution Tracking

**Contributors attest to their work toward meeting these needs:**
- Use **"Did this"** boards for self-attestation
- Use **Task Buddy** for mutual validation
- Digital platforms can track subscriptions fulfilled, materials provided, hours contributed
- Blockchain can create immutable records across distributed Holons

### 3. Flow Token Distribution

**Monthly or lunar cycle distributions:**
- Calculate total available resources for distribution (community income, grants, member contributions, sales)
- Weight contributions based on community-defined criteria (hours worked, needs met, impact created, scarcity of skill)
- Distribute flow tokens proportionally to contributors
- Tokens can be redeemed for money, goods, services, or held as credit for future needs

### 4. Multi-Resource Exchange

**Tokens represent generalized value that can convert to:**
- Money (for external trade or personal needs)
- Access to community resources (housing, food, tools, land)
- Services from other members (childcare, education, healthcare)
- Governance influence (some systems weight decision-making by contribution)
- Cross-Holon exchange (tokens from one community accepted by another in the network)

## Implementation Models

### Model 1: Time-Based (Simplest)

**Everyone's hour is valued equally:**
- Track hours contributed toward community needs
- Distribute available resources proportionally to hours
- 10 hours of childcare = 10 hours of carpentry = 10 hours of facilitation

**Pros:** Simple, egalitarian, honors all work equally
**Cons:** Doesn't account for scarcity, expertise, or differential demand

### Model 2: Need-Based Weighting

**Weight contributions by how much they meet expressed needs:**
- If 10 people request childcare but only 1 provides it, childcare hours are weighted higher
- Abundant contributions (many people offering) are weighted lower
- Scarce contributions (few people offering) are weighted higher

**Pros:** Aligns incentives with actual needs, encourages filling gaps
**Cons:** More complex calculation, can create gaming dynamics

### Model 3: Impact-Based

**Weight contributions by regenerative impact:**
- Activities that restore soil, sequester carbon, heal trauma, or build capacity get higher weights
- Extractive activities get lower or no weight
- Community defines impact metrics (e.g., "50% of farmland restoring nature" from regenerative licenses)

**Pros:** Drives toward regenerative outcomes, makes values explicit
**Cons:** Requires measuring impact, can be subjective

### Model 4: Hybrid Multi-Dimensional

**Combine multiple factors:**
- Base recognition for hours contributed
- Multiplier for need (scarcity weighting)
- Multiplier for impact (regenerative outcomes)
- Bonus for activities that build community capacity (teaching, documentation, tool creation)

**Pros:** Comprehensive, balances multiple values
**Cons:** Complex, requires clear algorithms and transparency

## Blockchain Integration

**For distributed networks coordinating multiple Holons:**

**Smart Contracts:** Automatically distribute tokens based on attestations and community-defined algorithms.

**Immutable Records:** Contributions tracked on blockchain create permanent, verifiable history.

**Cross-Holon Exchange:** Tokens earned in one community can be spent in another within the network.

**Transparent Algorithms:** Distribution logic is visible and auditable by all participants.

**Programmable Rules:** Can encode regenerative requirements (e.g., "only contributions that maintain 50% habitat restoration qualify").

## Connection to REGENERATIVA's Three Pathways

Flow tokens support all three pathways for meeting needs:

**1. Purchase Pathway:** Money flows into the network when someone buys a solution. That money becomes available for flow token distribution, supporting contributors who created the solution.

**2. Produce Pathway:** When someone becomes a production center using open-source plans, their ongoing work toward subscriber needs generates flow tokens each cycle.

**3. Attract Pathway:** When multiple people pool resources collectively (land, labor, materials, expertise), each contribution generates flow tokens, enabling the resource to manifest through distributed effort.

## Example Distribution Cycle

**Month 1 at Holon Alpha:**

**Community needs posted:**
- Fresh bread: 20 loaves weekly
- Garden maintenance: 10 hours weekly
- Solar panel repair: 1 project
- Childcare: 15 hours weekly
- Facilitation: 2 community meetings

**Contributions attested:**
- Alex: Baked 80 loaves (16 hours)
- Jordan: Garden work (40 hours)
- Casey: Repaired solar panels (8 hours)
- Riley: Provided childcare (60 hours)
- Sam: Facilitated 2 meetings (4 hours)

**Total community funds available:** $5,000 from member contributions + product sales

**Simple time-based distribution:**
- Total hours: 128
- Rate: $5,000 / 128 = $39/hour
- Alex receives: $624
- Jordan receives: $1,560
- Casey receives: $312
- Riley receives: $2,340
- Sam receives: $156

**Need-weighted distribution (childcare scarce, garden abundant):**
- Childcare weighted 2x (high need, few providers)
- Garden weighted 0.5x (many volunteers available)
- Others weighted 1x
- Recalculate and distribute accordingly

## Starting Simple

**Phase 1 - Track Contributions:**
- Use "Did this" boards
- Don't distribute tokens yet
- Just build the practice of attestation and visibility

**Phase 2 - Small Pools:**
- Start with a small monthly pool ($500, or 10% of community income)
- Distribute equally or time-based
- Learn what works and what creates issues

**Phase 3 - Iterate:**
- Add weighting factors based on what the community values
- Increase pool size as trust builds
- Refine algorithms based on real experience

**Phase 4 - Scale:**
- Connect to other Holons
- Enable cross-community exchange
- Build blockchain infrastructure for distributed coordination

## Potential Challenges

**Gaming:** People might inflate contributions. Counter with peer validation, buddy systems, and culture of honesty.

**Comparison:** Flow tokens can create unhealthy competition. Counter with emphasis on sufficiency, gratitude practices, and transparent criteria.

**Complexity:** Too many weighting factors become incomprehensible. Keep it as simple as possible while honoring community values.

**Exclusion:** Those unable to contribute labor (due to disability, care responsibilities, etc.) may feel excluded. Counter with broad definition of contribution (presence, wisdom, care work all count).

**External Dependence:** If flow tokens are only way to meet needs, it recreates wage dependence. Counter with ensuring baseline needs met before token distribution.

## Tips for Success

**Make Distribution Transparent:** Everyone should be able to see how tokens are calculated and distributed. Transparency builds trust.

**Start Generous:** If unsure about weighting, err toward recognizing contributions more rather than less. Abundance mindset.

**Include Non-Labor:** Someone offering land, tools, or materials is contributing even without doing physical work.

**Celebrate Recipients:** Token distribution moments are opportunities for gratitude and recognition, not just transactions.

**Allow Gifting:** Recipients should be able to gift their tokens to others or back to the collective pool.

**Regular Rhythm:** Monthly or lunar cycle distributions create predictable rhythm rather than transactional uncertainty.

**Build Reserves:** Don't distribute 100% of funds - maintain reserves for emergencies and large projects.

## Related Patterns

- **Did this:** Contribution tracking that feeds into flow token distribution
- **Offers and Requests:** Making needs visible that flow tokens can address
- **Task Buddy:** Mutual attestation supports accurate contribution tracking
- **Appreciative Scoring:** Peer recognition can inform distribution weighting
- **Consent Decision Making:** Community decides together how to structure distribution

Flow tokens transform extractive transactions into regenerative exchanges. Instead of "I sell you bread for money," it becomes "I contribute bread toward our collective needs, and the community ensures I have options through resource distribution." This shift - from isolated transactions to flowing abundance - is the economic foundation of regenerative networks.
